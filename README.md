         1. Compute Power | Storage | Networking
        -----------------------------------------
                   0. Security
        -----------------------------------------
You can think of the google cloud infrastructure in terms of these 3 layers. At the base is security and networking which lay the foundations to support all of googles infrastructure and applications. Then we have compute and storage which are decoupled so they can scale independently based on needs and on top we have big data and ML products which enable us to perform tasks to ingest, store, process, and deliver business insights, data pipelines, and ML models.
### Big Data and Machine Learning on Google Cloud
#### Compute
Google offers a range of computing services:
1. Compute Engine
a IaaS offering which provides raw compute, storage and network capabilities organized virtually into resources that are similar to physical data centers. Provides maximum flexibility for those who prefer to manage server instances themselves. 
2.  Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)
runs containerized applications in a Cloud environment, as opposed to on an individual virtual machine like Compute Engine. A container represents code packaged up with all its dependencies.
3.  App Engine
A fully managed PaaS (platform as a service) that provides access to infrasstructure appliation needs. This allows more resources to be focused on app.iation logic.
4. Cloud Functions
Executes code and responds to events like when a new file is uploaded to cloud storage. It is a completely serverless execution environment, often referred to as Functions as a service
#### Storage
For proper scaling capabilities, compute and storage are decouples. (major diference between Cloud and desktop computing)
With the Compute engine you can install and run a database on a virtual machine (like in a datacenter) Alternatively GCP offers fully managed database and storage services;
1. Cloud storage
2. Cloud Bigtable,
3. Cloud SQL
4. Cloud Spanner
5. Firestore


_structured vs unstructured data_

The right option depends on the data type and the business need unstructured data includes documents, images and audio files. This is best suited to Cloud storage which has 4 primary stroage classes
1. Standard Storage - best for requently accessed data (hot data) or data that is only stored for short periods of time
2. Nearline Storage - best for infrequent data (once per month) e.g. backups, archiving, longtail multimedia content
3. Coldline Storage - Once every 90 days
4. Archive Storage - Once per year

Structured data includes information stored in tables. It can be split into transactional workloads and analytical workloads. Transactional workload stem from online transactional processing systems, which are used when fast data inserts and updates are required to build row-based records. This is usually to maintain a system snapchat. They require relatively standardized queries that impact only a few records.  Analytical workloads which stem from online analytical processing systems, which are used when entire datasets need to be read. They often require complex queries.

#### Big Data and ML products
Google ML and Big Data products can be divided into 4 general categories along the data to AI workflow
1. Ingestion and process - Pub/Sub, Dataflow, Dataproc & Coud Data Fusion
3. Storage - listed above
3. Analytics - BigQuery, Google data studio and looker
4. Machine Learning

     4.1. ML development platform - Vertex AI, Auto ML, Vertex AI workbench, Tensor Flow

     4.2. AI Solutions - Document AI, Contact Center AI, Retail Product Discovery, Healthcare data engine
