You can think of the google cloud infrastructure in terms of these 3 layers. At the base is security and networking which lay the foundations to support all of googles infrastructure and applications. Then we have compute and storage which are decoupled so they can scale independently based on needs and on top we have big data and ML products which enable us to perform tasks to ingest, store, process, and deliver business insights, data pipelines, and ML models.
